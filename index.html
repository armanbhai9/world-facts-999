<h1><p align="center">Global Warming</p></h1>
<hr>
Hello freinds.<br>
In this article, we are gonna converse about the global problem named Global Warming.<br>
It is a very large problem which completely affects the nature and also affects many living beings. We created this problem so, it is our responsiblity to solve this problem.<br>
Global warming is an rise in temperature that is caused by the greenhouse ramification which is formed by the greenhouse gases like carbondioxide and many other gases. Many living beings are suffering from huge problems of the global warming.
We should look after the complication and also try to solve this.

Afforestation is the process of planting trees. This is the main step to stop the Global warming as trees are the main barrier to this problem as the trees take the carbondioxide and release oxygen also.
This is also needed as we are decreasing the no. of trees for our needs but to recover that, we should plant trees. The fruits that we eat, they have seeds, so, we can let the seed geerminate itself by planting it.
World Environment day is celebrated on 5th of June every year. On that day we should plant trees and make our earth green. Afforestation is now became a very foremost process in our life. This needs to be done on a large extent.

<br>
The government should look after the deforestation. The government should give LPG Gas Cylinder and gas oven to all people who have not so that they can also fulfil their needs and cutting down of plants can be minimised to some extent.
The government can also perform a method like on the side of the roads, there will be plants on which the lights should be hanging which will be switched on after 6pm.
The government can also plant trees.
The number of industries are increasing daily on a large extent. That should not be done. Many forests are being cut down and the area are becoming agricultural land or industrial areas. The ecosystem is being destroyed daily on a huge extent.
<br>
<br>
India is a huge country which had plenty of forests. But for human needs, they are cut down on a huge extent. The government should look after the forests.
Forests are our lifeline as they provide oxygen. Forests also serve as a habitat to many living organisms. They only bring clouds so that the rain occurs and they take the carbondioxide.
Forests need to be conserved.

<h2>Importance of plants in our ecosystem.</h2>
Plants are very monumental living beings in our ecosystem. We cannot make own oxygen, we cannot make our own food, thus we are called heterotrophs or consumers. We are mostly dependent on plants as they are only the source of the gas which lets us live, oxygen.
<ul>
	<li>We get wood for furnitures from plants like teak, rosewood, oak, deodar and cedar.</li>
	<li>Many plants like neem are used for producing theraputics. </li>
	<li>We get oxygen from plants.</li>
	<li>The plants take carbondioxide and maintain a balace of oxygen and carbondioxide in the atmosphere.</li>
	<li>The plants release water vapours to the atmosphere and thus they manage the temparature and rainfall. That's why where there are plants in a large number, there is more rainfall than the area where there are scarce plants.</li>
	<li>They also stabilise the soil.</li>
	<li>They also serve as shelter for many living organisms</li>
</ul>
